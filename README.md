# perfection-pizza
Perfection Pizza is a small game that I have been working on for the last two weeks, and was mainly just a way for me to practice coding. 
I hope that you have the patience to do some downloading and set the game up.

You will need to DOWNLOAD and INSTALL both Java Eclipse and Java in order to play. 
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ The latest version x86_64 should work just fine.
You'll also need to download the zip folder called "Perfection Pizza," of course.

Once you have downloaded/installed everything, open Eclipse, and this is where the (short) tutorial begins.
1. In the top-left click 'File > New > Java Project'
2. The name of the project can be anything you want, but "Perfection Pizza" is pretty cool so you should probably name it that.
   You should also just ignore all other settings besides the name.
3. Expand the java project, right click the source, or 'src', folder and delete it.
4. Right click the java project and click on 'Import'.
5. Expand 'General', click on 'Archive File', and then hit next.
6. Click on 'Browse' and then select that zip file that you downloaded.
7. Make sure all boxes on the left and right screens are selected, and also that the 'Into folder' is going to your java project.
8. Hit finish, and if asked hit 'yes to all' for overwriting.

After doing all of that the game should (hopefully) be playable by hitting the green run button on the top of the Eclipse window,
or also by clicking on 'Run' at the top, and then going to the green run button inside that path. Have fun! I promise the next game will be easier to start.

You can also mess around with the code if you want; go into 'src > pp > main > HUD' and give yourself a bunch of cash if you want, go crazy.
It's not the cleanest code in the world, and I'm pretty pissed that I can't really find a way to export it into JAR/EXE due to the sound libraries, but atleast I finished my game.

If you are having trouble with anything, or something isn't working.. please let me know, 
because I did not go crazy working on this game for it to just not work.
